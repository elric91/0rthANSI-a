4. No dedicated F1 to F12 needed, only through layers, so no 6th row needed
5. Large LSHIFT (TypeMatrix style, but no middle BKSP or ENTER)
6. AltGr (RALT) near the center to ease access to @, | ot []
7. No RCTRL
8. No CAPSLOCK (available through layers if needed)
9. Dedicated arrow Keys (HOME, EOL, PGUP & PGDOWN through layers)
